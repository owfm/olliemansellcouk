## StoneX, London [2020<span>&#8211;</span>now, Full Time]

StoneX is a Fortune 100 multinational which provides commodity trading services to a wide variety of clients. As a member of the development team supporting the metals front office, my role has mainly been on greenfield projects developing services in support of the base- and precious-metal trading and operations staff.

### Selected projects:

**Trade Execution Platform**: Primary developer on the base metal team's flagship trade execution project. This project will afford in-house traders as well as clients direct access to market price and trade execution facility, from within our enterprise micro-frontend platform. I was responsible for making a basic POC production-ready, including a large re-write of the main Java backend service, a fully-responsive and accessible redesign of the trading widget, and full-stack design and implementation of a separate "activity log" widget.

**Credit Optimisation Tool**: A data exploration and visualisation tool built in React/Typescript, with an express backend service acting as a cache/query layer. The tool affords front-office staff excellent visibility of their client accounts, allowing them to explore allocation of credit lines in comparison with revenue via a rich search, aggregation and filtering interface. The first phase release of this tool has been hugely successful, and I was asked to present it the CEO and executive committee as a potential strategic tool to be expanded and rolled out to other business lines.
